Winter's Love
Frosted trees in silver hue,
Whispers soft where winds pass through.
Blankets white on earth's still face,
Winter wraps in calm embrace.

Crystal skies and breath's faint mist,
Nature sleeps, by cold lips kissed.
Quiet beauty, pure and deep,
Winter dreams in peaceful sleep.winter changed file
